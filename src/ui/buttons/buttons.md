# Buttons

Use the semantic button wherever possible. Applying the button class to  `<span>` element should be the exception and not the rule.

## Button classes
For buttons with the primary color, `.button` should be used for the primary call to action, while `.button-secondary` is not as pronuced.

```html
<button class="button">Button element</button>
<span class="button">Button span</span>
<button class="button button-secondary">Button element</button>
<span class="button button-secondary">Button span</span>

```
